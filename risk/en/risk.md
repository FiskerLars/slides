# Security Means Making Trade-Offs to Manage Risks

- Security isn't having the strongest lock or the best anti-virus software — security is about making trade-offs to manage risk, something we do in many contexts throughout the day.
- When you consider crossing the street in the middle of the block rather than at a cross-walk, you are making a security trade-off: you consider the *threat* of getting run over versus the trouble of walking to the corner, and assess the *risk* of that *threat* happening by looking for oncoming cars.
- Your bodily safety is the *asset* you're trying to protect.
- How high is the *risk* of getting run over and are you in such a rush that you're willing to tolerate it, even though the *threat* is to your most valuable *asset*?
- That's a security decision. Not so hard, is it? It's just the language that takes getting used to.
- Security professionals use four distinct but interrelated concepts when considering security decisions: *assets*, *threats*, *risks* and *adversaries*.

# Assets

- What You Are Protecting
- An asset is something you value and want to protect.
- Anything of value can be an asset, but in the context of this discussion most of the assets in question are information.
- Examples are you or your organization's emails, instant messages, data files and web site, as well as the computers holding all of that information.

# Threats

- What You Are Protecting Against
- A threat is something bad that can happen to an asset.
- Security professionals divide the various ways threats can hurt your data assets into six sub-areas that must be balanced against each other:

- 1. Confidentiality - is keeping assets or knowledge about assets away from unauthorized parties.
- 2. Integrity - is keeping assets undamaged and unaltered.
- 3. Availability - is the assurance that assets are available to parties authorized to use them.
- 4. Consistency - is when assets behave and work as expected, all the time.
- 5. Control - is the regulation of access to assets.
- 6. Audit - is the ability to verify that assets are secure.

# Threat Classification
- Threats can be classified based on which types of security they threaten.
- For example, someone trying to read your email (the asset) without permission threatens its *confidentiality* and your *control* over it.
- If, on the other hand, an adversary wants to destroy your email or prevent you from getting it, the adversary is threatening the email's integrity and *availability*.
- Using encryption, as described later in this guide, you can protect against several of these threats.
- Encryption not only protects the *confidentiality* of your email by scrambling it into a form that only you or your intended recipient can descramble, but also allows you to *audit* the emails — that is, check and see that the person claiming to be the sender is actually that person, or confirm that the email wasn't changed between the sender and you to ensure that you've maintained the email's integrity and your *control* over it.

# Risks - The Likelihood of a Threat Actually Occuring

- Risk is the likelihood that a particular threat against a particular asset will actually come to pass, and how damaged the asset would be.
- There is a crucial distinction between threats and risks: threats are the bad things that can happen to assets, but risk is the likelihood that specific threats will occur.
- What assets are you trying to protect?
- What are the risks to those assets?
- How well does the security solution mitigate those risks?
- What other risks does the security solution cause?
- What costs and trade-offs does the security solution impose?
- Security is the art of balancing the value of the asset you are trying to protect against the costs of providing protection against particular risks.
- Practical security requires you to realistically judge the actual risk of a threat in order to decide which security precautions may be worth using to protect an asset, and which precautions are absolutely necessary.

# Adversaries

- Who Poses a Threat?
- A critical part of assessing risk and deciding on security solutions is knowing who or what your adversary is.
- An adversary, in security-speak, is any person or entity that poses a threat against an asset.
- Different adversaries pose different threats to different assets with different risks; different adversaries will demand different solutions.
- For example, if you want to protect your house from a random burglar, your lock just needs to be better than your neighbors', or your porch better lit, so that the burglar will choose the other house.
- If your adversary is the government, though, money spent on a better lock than your neighbors' would be wasted — if the government is investigating you and wants to search your house, it won't matter how well your security compares to your neighbors.
- You would instead be better off spending your time and money on other security measures, like encrypting your valuable information so that if it's seized, the government can't read it.

# Examples of Adversaries that Pose a Threat to Digital Privacy and Security
Here are some examples of the kinds of adversaries that may pose a threat to your digital privacy and security:

- U.S. government agents that follow laws which limit their activities
- U.S. government agents that are willing and able to operate without legal restrictions
- Foreign governments
- Civil litigants who have filed or intend to file a lawsuit against you
- Companies that store or otherwise have access to your data
- Individual employees who work for those companies
- Hackers or organized criminals who randomly break into your computer, or the computers of companies that store your data
- Hackers or organized criminals that specifically target your computer or the computers of the companies that store your data
- Stalkers, private investigators or other private parties who want to eavesdrop on your communications or obtain access to your machines

# Which Threats from Which Adversaries Pose the Highest Risk to Your Assets?
- Putting these concepts together, you need to evaluate which threats to your assets from which adversaries pose the most risk, and then decide how to manage the risk.
- Intelligently trading off risks and costs is the essence of security.
- How much is it worth to you to manage the risk?
- For example, you may recognize that government adversaries pose a threat to your webmail account, because of their ability to secretly subpoena its contents.
- If you consider that threat from that adversary to be a high risk, you may choose not to store your email messages with the webmail company, and instead store it on your own computer.
- If you consider it a low risk, you may decide to leave your email with the webmail company — trading security for the convenience of being able to access your email from any internet-connected computer.
- Or, if you think it’s an intermediate risk, you may leave your email with the webmail company but tolerate the inconvenience of using encryption to protect the confidentiality of your most sensitive emails.
- In the end, it’s up to you to decide which trade-offs you are willing to make to help secure your assets.
